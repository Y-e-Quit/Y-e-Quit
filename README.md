👋 Hi, I’m @Y-e-Quit

- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things and advancing in my programming skills. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C for embeded Systems and JavaScript for Webpage developments
- 🎨 Dabbling in the art of UI/UX design! Loving the blend of creativity and code. 🎨💻
- 🎧 Mixing music and code - Ask me about my programming playlists! 🎧🎶
  
Currently, I work on an STM32 Repository. But if I find time in between work and the mentioned repository, I try to develop my own Webpage.
Maybe you are lucky and find it someday online. 😉
Check out my STM32 Repository and stay tuned for my upcoming personal website!
